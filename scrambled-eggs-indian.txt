6 eggs
1 medium onion
2 tbsp butter
1 tsp cumin powder
1 tsp coriander powder
Salt and pepper to taste

- Dice the onion fine. 
- Crack open the eggs in a large bowl, and beat with a whisk until the yolk and white are blended.
- In large skillet, melt butter on medium heat. 
- When it is melted, add the onions and turn heat to high.
- Fry onions, stirring, for about five minutes until they are brown at edges.
- Lower heat to medium. Add the coriander and cumin and stir vigorously until they become aromatic, about 15 seconds. 
- Add the beaten eggs, salt, and pepper. Stir constantly until the eggs are almost fully cooked. They should look ever so slightly glutinous when you turn off the heat, as they will continue to cook for a little while even after that. 
- Serve with toast and butter.
